# Receptek

An easy-to-search selection of recipes, found in magazines, cookbooks or passed down through word of mouth. 

### Development
After cloning the repository and installing the dependencies, make sure to run `pnpm build:index`. This generates a file used as a search index and as the input of the `/recept` listing.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/plungingChode/receptek.git
cd receptek
pnpm install
pnpm build:index
pnpm dev
```
